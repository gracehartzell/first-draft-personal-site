                    <h2>Galvanize Standard 1: Go-Git-R or Go-Getter? </h2>
                    <p>For this standard, I did a mixture of a learning journal and a blog post 
                        that work together to demonstrate some of the concepts that I’ve learned. I wrote my notes in a Google Doc and
                        then used iframe to embed them to the Blog Page. Additionally, I've been working on a few courses from various
                        sites including Udemy, Codecademy, and Lynda. I've been practicing my skills on sites like Codewars and Repl. 
                        The majority of substance in my learning log is HTML and CSS; however, I've spent much more time on JavaScript 
                        than either of those combined. I typically take notes by hand, so a lot of my JS notes have yet to be typed. 
                        Due to that, I've made sure to include a variety of practice problems I've done in JS.</p>

                        My work is saved in a repository on Github entitled <a href="https://github.com/gracehartzell/projectEuler.git" style="color:#555f88bd;">projectEuler</a>.
                        As for the apocalypse issue: I'm not the go-to person for a wide variety of problems for nothing. </p>

                    <h2>Galvanize Standard 3: A New Dr. Frankenstein?</h2>
                    <p>My approach to building a blog from scratch was both exciting and frustrating. Starting a personal website has been on my to-do list for 
                        quite some time, so this was the perfect opportunity for me to buckle down and commit it. My initial plan was to take a template from online; however, 
                        my boyfriend let me know that that route wasn’t acceptable since I had the tools, knowledge, and resources to do it on my own. 
                        Especially since I love building things (and creating a site from scratch would help keep me out of “trouble” which for me is cleaning 
                        and organizing too much). </p>
                        <p>I’ve used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make this and have documented some of my notes as a 
                        learning log. One thing I do know is that my code is not particularly neat or concise. It’s pretty neat to think that I’ll be able to 
                        go back through the log of pushes to Github and see how my code has transformed over time. 
                        The biggest takeaway for me is that I can’t simply take a crash course in web development and then breeze through tasks 
                        like I have with singing and piano. I actually have to work for it and that is so incredibly satisfying.
