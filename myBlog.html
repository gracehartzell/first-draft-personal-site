                        <h2>Practice Makes <strike>Perfect</strike> Permanent </h2>
                            <p>Typically, I’ve skipped practice problems during lessons on some websites thinking that it was not pertinent. I still catch myself trying 
                                to, but after reading an article on Hackernoon I had a sort of epiphany that this is exactly what I’ve always done with lessons. For 
                                piano, I’d frequently neglect to practice my scales before going on to practice the more challenging pieces. Choir, I simply wouldn’t 
                                look over the words or precise melody until I was in the process of going through it with the rest of the choir. The practice problems 
                                are there to help ensure you’ve fully digested the material. Perhaps my biggest challenge yet with learning JavaScript has been not taking 
                                the right amount of notes--my happy medium in notetaking is about as consistent as our 11 week old puppy’s housetraining--and going straight 
                                for the challenging problems instead of committing lessons to memory.
